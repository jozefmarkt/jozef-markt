# ðŸš¨ URGENT SECURITY ALERT ðŸš¨

## What Happened
GitGuardian detected that your Supabase Service Role JWT was exposed on GitHub. This is a **CRITICAL** security breach.

## What Was Exposed
1. **Supabase Service Role Key** - Gives FULL database access
2. **Supabase Anon Key** - Public API access
3. **Admin Password** - Website admin access
4. **Supabase Project URL** - Your database location

## Immediate Actions Required (DO THIS NOW!)

### 1. Revoke Exposed Keys in Supabase
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `wsqcpoexahwqnafyvsbh`
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
4. **Regenerate** both the anon key and service role key
5. **Copy the new keys** (you'll need them)

### 2. Create Your .env File
1. Copy `env-example.txt` to `.env`
2. Fill in the new keys from Supabase
3. **NEVER commit .env to Git**

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Test Your Setup
```bash
npm run dev
```

## What I Fixed
- âœ… Removed hardcoded secrets from all files
- âœ… Added environment variable support
- âœ… Added dotenv dependency
- âœ… Created env-example.txt template

## Security Best Practices Going Forward
1. **Never hardcode secrets** in source code
2. **Always use environment variables**
3. **Keep .env files out of Git** (already in .gitignore)
4. **Rotate keys regularly**
5. **Use different keys for different environments**

## Files Modified
- `src/config/admin.ts` - Admin credentials now use env vars
- `src/services/supabase.ts` - Supabase config now uses env vars
- `setup-categories.js` - Script now uses env vars
- `create-categories-table.js` - Script now uses env vars
- `fix-rls.js` - Script now uses env vars
- `setup-database.js` - Script now uses env vars
- `test-category-creation.js` - Script now uses env vars
- `package.json` - Added dotenv dependency

## Next Steps
1. Complete the key rotation in Supabase
2. Create your .env file with new keys
3. Test that everything works
4. Consider enabling 2FA on your Supabase account
5. Monitor for any suspicious activity

## Need Help?
If you encounter issues after making these changes, check:
1. Your .env file exists and has correct values
2. You've regenerated the Supabase keys
3. All environment variables are properly set

**Remember: Security is everyone's responsibility. Stay vigilant!**
