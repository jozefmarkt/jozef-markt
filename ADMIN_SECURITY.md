# Admin Security Implementation

## Overview
The admin dashboard now implements comprehensive security measures to protect against unauthorized access and common attack vectors.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Environment-Based Credentials
- Admin credentials are now stored in environment variables instead of hardcoded values
- Use `.env` file to set secure credentials:
  ```
  VITE_ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
  VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
  ```

### 2. Session Management
- **Secure Session Tokens**: 64-character hexadecimal tokens generated using `crypto.getRandomValues()`
- **Session Expiration**: Sessions automatically expire after 24 hours
- **Token Validation**: Session tokens are validated for format and length
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Invalid or expired sessions are automatically cleared

### 3. Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection
- **Failed Attempt Tracking**: Tracks login attempts per session
- **Account Lockout**: Account locked after 5 failed attempts
- **Lockout Duration**: 15-minute lockout period
- **Persistent Lockout**: Lockout persists across browser sessions
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows remaining attempts and lockout countdown

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Required Field Validation**: Username and password must not be empty
- **Input Sanitization**: Trims whitespace from inputs
- **Form Disabling**: Form disabled during lockout periods

### 5. Authentication Flow
- **Loading States**: Prevents multiple simultaneous login attempts
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without exposing system details
- **Session Persistence**: Maintains login state across page refreshes
- **Automatic Redirect**: Redirects authenticated users away from login page

### 6. Route Protection
- **Protected Routes**: All admin routes require authentication
- **Automatic Redirect**: Unauthenticated users redirected to login
- **Loading States**: Shows loading spinner during authentication checks

### 7. Logout Functionality
- **Secure Logout**: Clears all session data and tokens
- **User Feedback**: Shows current logged-in user
- **Immediate Redirect**: Logs out user immediately

## Security Best Practices

### For Production Deployment:

1. **Change Default Credentials**
   - Update `VITE_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file
   - Use strong, unique passwords (12+ characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols)

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use different credentials for development and production
   - Consider using a secrets management service for production

3. **HTTPS Only**
   - Ensure your production site uses HTTPS
   - Set secure and httpOnly cookies if implementing server-side sessions

4. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Regularly review and update credentials
   - Monitor login attempts and failed access patterns
   - Consider implementing additional security measures like 2FA

5. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Keep secure backups of admin credentials
   - Have a recovery process for lost admin access

## Technical Implementation Details

### Session Token Generation
```typescript
const generateSessionToken = (): string => {
  const array = new Uint8Array(32);
  crypto.getRandomValues(array);
  return Array.from(array, byte => byte.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
};
```

### Rate Limiting Logic
- Tracks attempts in localStorage
- Implements exponential backoff (15-minute lockout)
- Persists across browser sessions
- Automatically resets on successful login

### Session Validation
- Validates token format (64 hex characters)
- Checks session age (24-hour expiration)
- Clears invalid sessions automatically

## Monitoring & Logging

The system includes console logging for security events:
- Login attempts (username only, no password logging)
- Failed authentication attempts
- Session creation and validation
- Logout events

## Future Security Enhancements

Consider implementing these additional security measures:

1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
2. **IP-based access restrictions**
3. **Audit logging for admin actions**
4. **Session timeout warnings**
5. **Password complexity requirements**
6. **Account recovery mechanisms**
7. **API rate limiting for admin endpoints**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Account temporarily locked"**
   - Wait for lockout period to expire (15 minutes)
   - Clear browser localStorage to reset attempts (not recommended for security)

2. **Session expired unexpectedly**
   - Sessions expire after 24 hours
   - Re-login to create new session

3. **Environment variables not working**
   - Ensure `.env` file is in project root
   - Restart development server after changing environment variables
   - Check variable names start with `VITE_`
